Ved model for hand-coded file building
- design ved model on top of graf model
- design level-building ved commands in their JSONy glory
  - add wall cluster with two parts (x, y, x, y)
  - add portal cluster with two parts (x, y, x, y)
  - add single-part cluster (type, x, y)
    - player assembler
    - block
    - button
    - grip
    - zapper
    - door
    - beamsensor
    - timer
  - add exit (x, y, URL)
  - add wire (outputJack, inputJack)

Ved-to-Vorp transformer
- walls
- one-point wall-huggers
  - assembler
  - button
  - grip
- two-point wall-huggers
  - beamsensor
  - door
  - zapper
- free-floaters:
  - block
  - exit
  - portal
  - timer

Play level written entirely with ved actions.

Logic: Part I
- design all logic parts needed for existing levels
- ved commands
- ved concequences

Logic: Part II
- vorp support for clocked logic parts
- ved-to-vorp transformer support
- rewrite a wiring test level

Total Conversion:
- Rewrite all levels as ved action JSON.
- Redo all logic support in prefabs.
- Delete levelbuilder.js.

============== VED UI ============
Ved model for interactive editing
- write invariant-enforcing concequence computer
  - deleting one portal or wall-endpoint deletes the whole cluster
  - other wall endpoint moves minimum distance to remain coaxial
  - deleting any part deletes all jacks and links and data first
  - deleting last part in a cluster deletes cluster


ATTIC
GrafRenderer
- part: circle
- cluster: transparent poly or outline
- links as curves
- jack "positions", dynamic based on linked part positions and separation around part
- labels
  - obj ids
  - data

Insta-graf
- edit in text area
- render edit
- data in URL

Graf consequence calculator
- deleting any obj deletes its data hash
- deleting jack deletes links
- deleting part deletes jacks
- deleting cluster deletes parts
