v Hella design work

2011.08.26 -
Graf op JSON format
v JSON schema for ops
v Op reversal fn
- Action JSON schema (intentions and concequences)
- Action reversal fn

Graf model
- build from ops
- write invariant-enforcing concequence computer?
  - deleting any obj deletes its data hash
  - deleting jack deletes links
  - deleting part deletes jacks
  - deleting cluster deletes parts
- nice text representation for debugging

Ved model
- design all ved commands in their JSONy glory
- write extra Ved-specific invariant-enforcing concequence computer
  - deleting one portal or wall-endpoint deletes the whole cluster
  - other wall endpoint moves minimum distance to remain coaxial
Note: Ved enforcement happens before graf enforcement.  Maybe graf concequences need
to be visible to Ved in case a Graf concequence triggers another Ved rule?  Or
maybe not, because that's impossible?  There are no required links, and
jacks are dictated by part type.  Part constraints are enforced within clusters
by Ved alone.  No cluster requires another.  I think we're good.

Ved-to-Vorp transformer
- walls
- one-point wall-huggers
  - assembler
  - button
  - grip
- two-point wall-huggers
  - beamsensor
  - door
  - zapper
- free-floaters:
  - block
  - exit
  - portal
  - timer

Play level written entirely with ved actions.

Logic: Part I
- design all logic parts needed for existing levels
- ved commands
- ved concequences

Logic: Part II
- vorp support for clocked logic parts
- ved-to-vorp transformer support
- rewrite a wiring test level

Total Conversion:
- Rewrite all levels as ved action JSON.
- Redo all logic support in prefabs.
- Delete levelbuilder.js.
