New directory
v Official levels are on top, and not in localstorage.
v localstorage levels are just below official ones.
v "New Level" button adds a generic new level

Sharing
v Encoding
  v Encode any level into a linkifier-friendly URL, w hash param like level=data~your-data-here
  v Make a new "share" view that renders an encoded URL w instructions on how to use it.
  v round floating-pt precision during edits to shrink data size
v Decode level=data~your-data-here URLs

Read-only editor mode
v for data~ levels
v for builtin~ levels
v make sure clip copying still works
- visual cue that this is read-only. Maybe flash it in the UI when you fail an "editable" check?

Level copying to localstorage
v builtins can be copied
v data~ levels can be copied
v even local~ levels can be cloned, just to make it monotonous.

x Auto-update data URLs when you edit the data?? Or force a copy to localstorage?
Levels take a while to make and I don't want people to lose them because they close a tab.
So for now, you can't make edits to something that's not backed by localstorage.

x or when entering one.

Create new compact model serialization that uses parameterized templates and auto-assigned IDs.
[1 /* wall */, 100, 300, 100, 500] // x, y, x, y
[9 /* not */, 600, 200] // x, y
[8 /* link */, 12, 98] // jack IDs
etc. The auto-assigned IDs will be the trickiest bit.
So, define the template language (see doc) and do the ID mapping.
Specify the templates only once, and automate s27n.
Deserialization is easy.
But serialization relies on pattern matching.
I guess... a template matches a cluster if, after generifying the params of the cluster, it serializes to the
same JSON as the template. OK.
Ditto for link templates. Those should be easy, since there's only one form of link in Vorp.



Titles and Descriptions
- Add metadata cluster with title and description data
- Display those in Play mode.
- Make those editable in the editor
- Update builtin levels to include the old titles and descriptions
- Show titles in directory?

File rename

Polish
- Show intro paragraph on main page
- Make buttons not look so crappy
- Fast shifting between modes - kbd shortcuts like 1, 2, 3, 4, 0?  p, e, s, j, u? [, ], and u?

Milestone: Easy level sharing! Post levels as URLs!

===================================================================================

Add real Loopwood front page.
Add loopwood.com/vorp

Milestone: Move game stuff to new site (loopwood? photonpotato?) without eval XSS features.

===================================================================================

Editor Polish
- make wall grab-points long and aligned with the wall, like a lozenge, so corners can be pulled apart easily.
- curved wires
- arrows on jacks
- Draw portal link or cluster hilite or something.
- Esc to close dialogs
- Redo editor help.
  - "h" or "?" to toggle.
  - Show keyboard shortcuts organized by effect, not key.
- Improve highlighting. Those circles look kinda lame.
- Data Editing Polish
  - One button per field
  - Line up editor with button
  - Real-time editing w transformation and stuff as you type
  - Commit and end by
    - clicking off of the field
    - hitting "esc"
    - hitting "enter" (no multiline values?)
    - pushing "close" button?
  - Alert to invalid values as they are typed?
    - detect them in the transformation process?
    - turn field pink or something (don't do text, since "empty" might be invalid)
- Fix the snap-to-grid UI somehow.

===================================================================================
