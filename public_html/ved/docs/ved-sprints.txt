Sharing
v Encoding
  v Encode any level into a linkifier-friendly URL, w hash param like level=data~your-data-here
  v Make a new "share" view that renders an encoded URL w instructions on how to use it.
  v round floating-pt precision during edits to shrink data size
v Decode level=data~your-data-here URLs

Read-only editor mode
v for data~ levels
v for builtin~ levels
v make sure clip copying still works
- visual cue that this is read-only. Maybe flash it in the UI when you fail an "editable" check?

Level copying to localstorage
v builtins can be copied
v data~ levels can be copied
v even local~ levels can be cloned, just to make it monotonous.

x Auto-update data URLs when you edit the data?? Or force a copy to localstorage?
Levels take a while to make and I don't want people to lose them because they close a tab.
So for now, you can't make edits to something that's not backed by localstorage.
