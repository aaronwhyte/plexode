Refactor "phy" out of sprite constructors?
- Wrap Phy methods/fields in Game:
  v rayscan
  - getSpriteBySledgeId - always follows rayscan... Make it automatic?
  - FRICTION
  - invalidateSledgeForSpriteId
- Pass Game in where needed.
  - act()
  - onSpriteHit()
- Remove Phy from concrete sprite types. Only access Game fields.
- Remove Phy from gaam.Sprite

Ved-to-Vorp transformer
Reads GrafModel directly?
- walls
- one-point wall-huggers
  - assembler
  - button
  - grip
- two-point wall-huggers
  - beamsensor
  - door
  - zapper
- free-floaters:
  - block
  - exit
  - portal
  - timer

Ved Validate
x design ved model on top of graf model
- validate cluster, for every cluster type
- validate link

Play level written entirely with ved actions.

Logic: Part I
- design all logic parts needed for existing levels
- ved commands
- ved concequences

Logic: Part II
- vorp support for clocked logic parts
- ved-to-vorp transformer support
- rewrite a wiring test level

Total Conversion:
- Rewrite all levels as ved action JSON.
- Redo all logic support in prefabs.
- Delete levelbuilder.js.

============== VED UI ============
Ved UI API:
- iteration for rendering
- spacial queries
  - mouseover
  - drag selection
  - alter selection
- copy selection to a clipboard
- changes
  - paste from a clipboard
  - link
  - delete
  - undo
- previews
  - linking
  - paste preview
  - dragging parts

Ved model for interactive editing
- write invariant-enforcing concequence computer
  - deleting one portal or wall-endpoint deletes the whole cluster
  - other wall endpoint moves minimum distance to remain coaxial
  - deleting any part deletes all jacks and links and data first
  - deleting last part in a cluster deletes cluster


ATTIC
GrafRenderer
- part: circle
- cluster: transparent poly or outline
- links as curves
- jack "positions", dynamic based on linked part positions and separation around part
- labels
  - obj ids
  - data

Insta-graf
- edit in text area
- render edit
- data in URL

Graf consequence calculator
- deleting any obj deletes its data hash
- deleting jack deletes links
- deleting part deletes jacks
- deleting cluster deletes parts
