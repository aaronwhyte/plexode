v Ved usable by me for editing.
v Some way to publish levels
  v JSON view + cut-n-paste?
v Convert some existing levels from LevelProg code to JSON, to test-publish Ved output.
- Change level creation flow
  - Add "new level" button to vedapp home
  - Remove list of existing levels from ved.
  - Change vorpLevels from key/val pair to array, removing name and desc.
- Actually make new levels.
  - Instructions
    - 1: Move with the arrow keys. It's OK to bump into walls. Touch the green thingy to go to the next level.
    - 2: You can push things out of your way.
    - 3: Touch buttons and sensors to make things happen.
    - 4: Dying is no big deal. Sometimes you need to do it on purpose to solve a level.
    - 5: You've got a tractor beam! Hold Z while moving around to grab things. Press X to let go.
    - 6: Once you've grabbed something, hold Z for a strong grip, or let go of Z to let it flop around.
    - 7: You can throw things. Grab something. Then hold Z, and while holding it, tap X.
    - 8: The blue squares are teleporters, which come in pairs. Touch one to teleport to the other.
    - 9: You can grab a teleporter and carry it around. And you can teleport things by hitting them with a teleporter.

Portal tweaks
- They push away from teleport-blocking objects so they're unobstructed.
- While they ARE obstructed they kind of show it
- They do something cool when something teleports
- They're clearly teleporters and not blocks or something. Hypersquare thing?

Player tweaks
- Put a little meh-face on it with eyes that move!
- Better death animations, depending on the manner of doom.
- Better assembly animation.
  - How about a little tree grows
  - and bears player as fruit
  - before disintegrating?

Exit tweaks
- look good before touch
- exit warp animation

Rendering performance improvements
- Prerender all immovable chunks like walls, and copy that out?

Background
- Starfield? Texture? Buildings?

Milestone: Production values go from "craptacular" to "weird retro vibe".
