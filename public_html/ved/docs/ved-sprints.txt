New directory
v Official levels are on top, and not in localstorage.
v localstorage levels are just below official ones.
v "New Level" button adds a generic new level

2013-09-29 done in one day!
Sharing
v Encoding
  v Encode any level into a linkifier-friendly URL, w hash param like level=data~your-data-here
  v Make a new "share" view that renders an encoded URL w instructions on how to use it.
  v round floating-pt precision during edits to shrink data size
v Decode level=data~your-data-here URLs

2013-09-29...
Read-only editor mode
v for data~ levels
v for builtin~ levels
v make sure clip copying still works

2013-09-30
Level copying to localstorage
v builtins can be copied
v data~ levels can be copied
v even local~ levels can be cloned, just to make it monotonous.

x Auto-update data URLs when you edit the data?? Or force a copy to localstorage?
Levels take a while to make and I don't want people to lose them because they close a tab.
So for now, you can't make edits to something that's not backed by localstorage.

Fix ghost noises
v clean up sounds when exiting level
x or when entering one.

Delete level from level view
v stor remove
v opstor remove
v delete button near copy button for local~ levels

Create new compact model serialization that uses parameterized templates and auto-assigned IDs.
[1 /* wall */, 100, 300, 100, 500] // x, y, x, y
[9 /* not */, 600, 200] // x, y
[8 /* link */, 12, 98] // jack IDs
etc. The auto-assigned IDs will be the trickiest bit.
So, define the template language (see doc) and do the ID mapping.
Specify the templates only once, and automate s27n.
Deserialization is easy.
But serialization relies on pattern matching.
I guess... a template matches a cluster if, after generifying the params of the cluster, it serializes to the
same JSON as the template. OK.
Ditto for link templates. Those should be easy, since there's only one form of link in Vorp.
v template class & unit test
v templates for all ved stuff
v replace sysclip info with data in templates, plus default vals for params
v templatizer
  v convert model into canonical JSON and then template JSON
  v convert template JSON into op JSON and then model
v change 'share' to start with template JSON, not op JSON
v change data URL deserialization to expect template params

2013-10-14
Convert all static levels to template JSON ?
v change 'json' view to template JSON, not op JSON
v change builtin~ levels to use template JSON, not op JSON
v replace all local levels

2013-10-14...
Titles and Descriptions
v Ved expects a partless cluster of type "meta", with "title" and "description" data.
v create template for that
v Display those in level header.
v Update builtin levels to include the old titles and descriptions
v Show titles in directory.

x File rename? Meh.

Final Push
v Show intro paragraph on main page
v Preserve mode across visits to directory.
v visual cue that official levels are read-only.
v visual cue that data-url levels are read-only.
v Make Title and Description editable in edit mode
v "Share" as a popup from Edit
Bugs
v Make sure a "Create level" level starts with a metadata cluster and a default title and description!
Or just remove the "create" button. Easier and less painful for new users?
v update main page

Milestone: Easy level sharing! Post levels as URLs!
DONE by, oooh, lets say 2013-10-30. Yay!

===================================================================================

Add real Loopwood front page.
Add loopwood.com/vorp

Milestone: Move game stuff to new site (loopwood? photonpotato?) without eval XSS features.

===================================================================================

Finish the sound effects.

===================================================================================

(((At this point it might be time to move on to a new project. This has gone on for at least 2 years.
But if not there's certainly more to do.)))


Editor Polish
- make wall grab-points long and aligned with the wall, like a lozenge, so corners can be pulled apart easily.
- curved wires
- arrows on jacks
- Draw portal link or cluster hilite or something.
- Esc to close dialogs
- Redo editor help.
  - "h" or "?" to toggle.
  - Show keyboard shortcuts organized by effect, not key.
- Improve highlighting. Those circles look kinda lame.
- Data Editing Polish
  - One button per field
  - Line up editor with button
  - Real-time editing w transformation and stuff as you type
  - Commit and end by
    - clicking off of the field
    - hitting "esc"
    - hitting "enter" (no multiline values?)
    - pushing "close" button?
  - Alert to invalid values as they are typed?
    - detect them in the transformation process?
    - turn field pink or something (don't do text, since "empty" might be invalid)
- Fix the snap-to-grid UI somehow.

===================================================================================

Touch UI
- zoom pinch
- pan: 2-finger drag
Without Selection
- drag unselected: down on unselected, drag, up
- link: down on linkpoint, drag to other linkpoint, up
Selection Itself
- select: touch: down on empty space, drag, up
- add top two selections: soft button
- subtract top selection from prev selection: soft button
- forget top selection: soft button?
With Selected Items
- drag selected: down on selected, drag, up.
- delete selected: button on select-box, or soft "delete" button
- copy selected: button on select-box, or soft "copy" button
- paste: This one is hard. Maybe drag from the pastable thing to the canvas. Or click the pastable thing to enter Paste Mode
Other:
- undo/redo: soft buttons
