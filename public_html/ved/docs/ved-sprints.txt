Editor Polish

- Esc to close dialogs
- Redo editor help.
  - "h" or "?" to toggle.
  - Show keyboard shortcuts organized by effect, not key.
- Improve highlighting. Those circles look kinda lame.

  - Line up editor with button
  - Real-time editing w transformation and stuff as you type
  - Commit and end by
    - clicking off of the field

    - detect them in the transformation process?
