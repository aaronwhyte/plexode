flail bounce
v flail kinda bounces hard when it hits something.

player health
- touching enemies hurts you
- death when health hits 0
- Add a game death mode which is less fun than being alive.

enemy fire
- enemies shoot randomly at first, for fun
- enemy bullets stopped by whatevs.
- hurts player

enemy behaviors
- avoid walls, boulders, and each other
- get closer to player
- scan for player and shoot when player is within scanning sweep

increasing difficulty
- individual enemies get stronger over time
 - enemies spawn at an increasing rate? or spawn with more initial strength?

score
- kill count.  More points for flail kill?  More points for stronger enemies?
- Limited time game?  Interesting - let enemies get as powerful as possible before killing them,
to mazimize score?
