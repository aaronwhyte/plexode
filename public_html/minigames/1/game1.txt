design:
- 4 walls
- scrolling plr-centered
- wall, plr, plr fire, enemy, enemyfire, misc rocks

Gameplay ideas:
- Level is an arena with walls forming a small maze or something.
- plr starts at plr spawn point
- enemies warp in at their spawn points in the 4 corners of the maze.
- individual enemies get stronger + larger over time. Kill while young!
  - more max hit points
  - more rapid fire
  - more bullets, spread out a bit
  - faster movement
  - faster bullets
  - longer bullet range
- player has 3 hit points, and heals over time.
- bullets do 1 point of damage
- survival time = score.
- player weapon is attached to player like vorp-tractored obj
- It blocks enemy shots, and hurts them when it hits them (w recharge time)
- It controls fire direction.

utils:
- key listener, event queue, event objects
- simple joystick util maybe?
- looper: set loop func, set fps, play, pause
- simple canvas renderer

event loop:
- process plr input
- clock world fwd
- draw

model:
- phy
- collider
- sprites: wall, plr, bullet, enemy

view:
- canvas
- renderer (basic utils for painters)
- painters: wall, plr, bullet, enemy, explosions
