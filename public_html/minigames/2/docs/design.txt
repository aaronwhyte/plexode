HYPERFLAIL
- Like burning flail except only collides w walls.
- Not throwable, but when you press fire, it become solid and supermassive,
  and you build up shot power. So it's a shield and, when you release, it can be a cannon.
  It fires opposite from where the player is
- only collides with walls
- constantly fires in direction of travel, throwing bullets w velocity of travel
- Swipe it around to surround self w deadly stuff
- Touch it to phase out for a sec?
- Hold fire to freeze it in place (absolute pos) and prep to fire away from player. Move plr to aim.
- Release fire to launch blast of accumulated energy. hold-time controls fire type?

enemy fire
- enemies shoot randomly at first, for fun
- enemy bullets stopped by whatevs.
- hurts player

enemy behaviors
- avoid walls, boulders, and each other
- get closer to player
- scan for player and shoot when player is within scanning sweep

increasing difficulty
- individual enemies get stronger over time
 - enemies spawn at an increasing rate? or spawn with more initial strength?

score
- kill count.  More points for flail kill?  More points for stronger enemies?
- Limited time game?  Interesting - let enemies get as powerful as possible before killing them,
to mazimize score?
