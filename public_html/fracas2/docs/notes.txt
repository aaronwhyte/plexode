Create level from text file.
Level can have hyperlinks to resources.
Player provides itself as a resource link

Resources:
level: grids, non-grid walls, other objects, player start, URLs for resources like monsters and objects. 
player: looks, inventory of objects, stats...?

Basic nethack-ish game code architecture:
player actions:
items: get, drop, throw, use, consume, weild/wear/slot, un-weild/un-wear/un-slot, eat/drink/read/consume, etc.
