Tool Ideas:

Guns
- shotgun, nach
- machine gun
- railgun
- crazygun
- r-type warm-up gun
- chainsaw!  Bullets fire away from player but return under constant acceleration.

Manipulators
- Puller: Simple tractor-particle-launcher that pulls player and target towards each other.  Works on walls!
- Kicker: Fires short pusher-particles that affect both player and target.  Also works on walls!
- Two click kicker: One to pick where the force comes from, and one to pick its force 
- Inertialess puller/kicker: Doesn't affect player.
- Some kinda sticky flail.  Fire it, it hits and attaches to whatever, then spring forces ensue.
- Grappling hook.  Mostly tricky because of all the chain elements.

Explosives
- Explosive rockets.
- Laser tripmines.  I <3 laser tripmines!
- Remotely detonated jobbers.
- Grenades.
- Proximity mines.

Sensing
- Sensor spray, if player isn't omniscient.
- Scent spray, for monsters that care.
- Fake player, to trick monsters.

Other
- Teleport Gun: Fires a player-sized particle, and player ends up wherever it hits.
- Portal gun: Player fires two teleporter endpoints.
- Wall Gun: Particles fire from player, to hit nearby walls.  Wall hits become Something Else.
- Brick Shooter: Semi-permanent heavy bricks can block stuff.
- Energy Flail for player to swing around.  Multiple links, even?
- Freezer: Temporarily transforms object into block of ice.
- Procrastinator: Vanish something into the future. (how to appear atop another thing?)
- Ignitable Gas.  Floats without colliding, converts to fire when touched by fire.
- Smoke.  Blocks sight particles with diminishing effectiveness (200%-->0%)
- Wind.  Affects gas.  Created by moving, too?

Cloak
Enter a monster, and pop out later.  Trick is you don't control the monster.
