This is service of Ved (Vorp level editor), but should be its own reusable class, so 'ere we are.

Uses:
- Persist Ved model clipboards, and instantly sync them across all Ved windows.
- Create levels
- Store and edits to levels in some append-only log and instantly sync them across windows.
- Get directory of levels.
- Support level renaming and deletion.
- Save misc settings and stuff maybe, w interwindow instasync.

I've got some file types in mind:
- append-often replayable list of JSON objects, for storing level-edit operations and hence levels
- simple JSON blobs, for settings and stuff
- plaintext
- file directory
Files will be uniquely addressable by directory path.


Implementation ideas:
Use HTML5 LocalStorage for persistence, and its events for interwindow instasync (IWIS).
Prefix all data entries with numeric codes (and some namespace prefix) like
ved-alpha/818726: {...}.
For the multipart log-like files, use sequential array-like numbering, too:
ved-alpha/173644/0: [{...}, ...]
ved-alpha/173644/1: [{...}, ...]
ved-alpha/173644/2: [{...}, ...]
Give each node some meta-data object with the a name and type.
ved-alpha/173644/meta: {name:..., type:...}
Whenever the name tree is adjusted, enforce path uniqueness, so files are still addressable.

Node numbers and log indexes should never be exposed to the API user.

Example with everything:
va/0/meta: {name: "", type: "directory"}
va/0: {101010:true, 987987:true, 123123:true}

va/101010/meta: {name:"readme", type:"plaintext"}
va/101010: "Welcome to example filesystem X"

va/987987/meta: {name:"settings", type:"json"}
va/987987: {playerTrails: false, showFps: true}

va/123123/meta: {name:"levels", type:"directory"}
va/123123: {234234:true} // just one level for this example

va/234234/meta: {name:"level 1", type:"json-log"}
va/234234/0: "[{...},...]"
va/234234/1: "[{...},...]"

So the dir tree is easy to generate:
/
/readme: ""
/settings: {}
/levels/level 1: [{},...]

Operations are pretty REST-y:
- put(path, type, value)
- post(path, addValue) // for log-types only
- get(path) // Returns contents.. and meta? For dirs, returns array of child names?
- delete(path) // Deletes one file. Can delete dirs if they are empty.
- getMeta(path)
- move(oldPath, newPath)
Secondary stuff:
- getDirectoryTree(path)
- deleteTree(path)
- tail(path)

A filespace object has a prefix (no uniqueness enforced).
It would be cute to log the operations of a filespace in another filespace, for debugging.
It would also be cool to store counters and snapshots here. HM!
And finally, in order to sync the filesystem changes, it might be smart to have a JSON changelog format. SO META.

Too bad there's no multi-window locking anywhere, unless you count the cloud itself. BRUTAL.
Shared workers aren't ready yet :-(.
