Sound! First pass:

infrastructure
v add soundfx to constructor
v add panner node
- Volume knob in the game controls gain node?

2013-06-11 to 2013-06-12
VorpOut:
v Refactor Vorp graphics, sound, painters, canvas manipulation, etc into new VorpOut class.
v Make that available to painters, instead of their renderers.
v Ditto for sparklists. Delete getRenderer.

Maybe refactor sprite factories into one big factory?

Singers
Sustained sound-makers are objects w state, tied to sprites. Setters, start, end. Like a painter, lives beyond sprite,
gets clocked, uses "kaput" disposal pattern.
v basic infra
  v Singer base class
  v VorpOut API w kaput cleanup
v prototype low-Hz oscillating gain w plexode
v player thrust as first working example

sound effects
v player thrust & motion
v player tractor beam
  v activated
  v scanning
  v deactivated
  v grabbed something
  v holding(strength, force)
  v kick(force)
  v break
- player assembly
  - One chord getting bent up two octaves, then blinking on and off a bit?
- gripper (refactor player tractorbeam code?)
  - proximity - scanning
  - grab
  - proximity - holding(force)
  - release
- exit
  - proximity noise
  - level complete
- button activate
- door
  - opening
  - closing
- scanner
  - activated
  - deactivated
- zapper
  - deactivated
  - activated
  - humming active
- collision noise rework?
  - player
  - wall
  - block
  - door
  etc.
v explosion
- portal
  v teleport in
  v teleport out
  - collision with unteleportables
- start level?

Sequencing, Sharing, Editing

Level sequence is a list of level sources.
A level source is squished level JSON, or a URL to level JSON.

Rendering performance improvements

- Prerender all immovable chunks like walls, and copy part of that each frame, instead of rerendering

- use requestAnimationFrame instead of timeouts when possible

==================================================================================

Switch overhaul.
* Grip-switches are awesome. Keep those.
* There are no toggles, but if there were, they would need their own switch types.
v replace all buttons and scanners with timer-idiom or one-time idiom.
- Integrate timers into buttons.
- Integrate timers into scanners, too.
- Make one-time touch targets and one-time doors to match.
- Remove infinite timers.
- Remove redundant timers.

Portal tweaks
v They push away from teleport-blocking objects so they're unobstructed.
x While they ARE obstructed they kind of show it
v They do something cool when something teleports
v They're clearly teleporters and not blocks or something. Hypersquare thing?

Player tweaks
- Put a little meh-face on it with eyes that move!
- Better death animations, depending on the manner of doom.
- Better assembly animation.
  - How about a little tree grows
  - and bears player as fruit
  - before disintegrating?

Exit tweaks
- look good before touch
- exit warp animation

Background
- Starfield? Texture? Buildings?

Milestone: Production values go from "craptacular" to "weird retro vibe".
