The Zombie Problem
When you create creatures from nothing, you can't expect them to always
turn out perfectly. Some are hideous monsters. But you love them as best
you can, because they are yours and you are a good entity. But you need
to set limits or they'll run wild. And limits must be clear. And they
must include concequences. And sometimes you can't give each of your
creatures the individual attention and guidance you would like to. So
you begin to deal in policy, broad strokes, blanket judgements. Maybe
you automate the application of discipline a little. Maybe the tools
you have to do so aren't perfect, but who is.
Long story short, these plasma turrets indicate the boundaries of
acceptable zombie behavior. On sight. With deadly plasma.

Graphics
Learn some WebGL

Portal tweaks
- They push away from teleport-blocking objects so they're unobstructed.
- While they ARE obstructed they kind of show it
- They do something cool when something teleports
- They're clearly teleporters and not blocks or something. Hypersquare thing?

Player tweaks
- Put a little meh-face on it with eyes that move!
- Better death animations, depending on the manner of doom.
- Better assembly animation.
  - How about a little tree grows
  - and bears player as fruit
  - before disintegrating?

Exit tweaks
- look good before touch
- exit warp animation

Rendering performance improvements
- Prerender all immovable chunks like walls, and copy that out?

Background
- Starfield? Texture? Buildings?

Milestone: Production values go from "craptacular" to "weird retro vibe".
