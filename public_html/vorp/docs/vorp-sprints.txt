BRIEF PAUSE FOR TEMPLATIZING

  v button - glow effect
  v timer - invisible
  v zapper - visible/invisible, and flicker.
PAUSE FOR SPARKS

2011.05.09 - 2011.05.26 with interruptions below
Sparks 1
So far, sparks are a design pattern, not a class,
but similar spark code can be could up to a painter helper class.
Sparks are implemented by a Painter in a few parts:
* A pile of spark state objects like this (but anything goes):
  {pos:Vec2d, vel:Vec2d, startTime:number, etc:etc}
* A mutator function to update a spark in-place, or delete it. Return false for delete?
* A loop that iterates over the pile, removing deleted ones in pile fashion,
  maybe mutating the rest.
  (Aside: Feels like Painters need now() and act(), or clock() or whatever,
  like Sprites.  Remove "now" from paint() and add advance(now).  OK, done.)
  Call from Painter.advance().
* A function to draw a spark (maybe at multiple layers),
  using a state object (and maybe the Painter's other state) as input.
  Call from Painter.draw().  Paydirt!
Add sparks to painters:
v grip
  v seeking
  v holding (and acceleration!)
v Generify tractor beam rendering, since we'll have at least 3 sprites that use 'em.
  v seek(rayScan): light sparkle along rayScan beam
  v hold(holderPos, holderVel, heldPos, heldVel, holdStrength): 
    v solid line indicating strength.
    v Maybe fade-bubbles along path or on target for higher-strength ones.
    x Emit fade-bubbles at source for high-strength grips?
    v awesome polygons instead of sparks?!
    v Quickly fade polygons in - don't just snap 'em in
v hook up to player
v hook up to gripswitch

2011.05.19 Fixed RayScan flaw.  Same as old cell-collider flaw:
Once you've found the earilest collision in a cell, you still have to check other cells
until you've gone past the cell with the collision *location*.
Say you have a wall that crosses a lot of cells.  If you scan nearly parallel to it,
you might hit it 5 cells away.  But there might still be something in a closer cell that
results in an earlier hit.

2011.05.23 Replace noisy tractorbeam sparks with awesome clean line-of-sight polygon sweeps.

2011.05.26 Cool portal preview grx

v keep track of all portals in play

v active spawner API at the Vorp level
v death & rebirth
v Redo all levels to start with a spawner

v remove player from collider upon death
  v but preserve painter
  v fix painter-removal logic and enhance stuff
v add DeadPlayer sprite
  v sprite, prefab, painter
  v calls vorp.assemblePlayer() after like 15 frames
v Cool Graphics
  v dead player
  v assembler
v push it!

2011 compile JS
v python function to find and compile all Vorp JS deps into filename passed in
  v create file manifest by searching some root dirs for JS files
  v make it dump jscomp warnings to stdout and/or a file

2011 deploy compiled JS
v Write make.py parallel to make.sh.
  v Compare output of make.sh and make.py as a test.
x Add -vorp_jscomp [off,warnings,deploy_readable,deploy_opt] flag to make.py.
v Make the off and warnings values work.
v Make deploy_* pass a param to Vorp level builders so they point to one file instead of a huge list.

HUGE BREAK FOR LEVEL EDITOR, "VED".
(Hey, I edited this file right in GitHub.  Pretty great!)
Did not finish yet but we're back for some saw sharpening...

2011.12 - 2012.01.03 refactor like a horse running backwards
v remove phy from sprite constructors
v convert sprites to use SpriteTemplate and more Vec2d.
v convert prefabs too
v Write proper Prefab superclass.
v Change Prefab.createXXX statics to methods.
v Pass a partially filled out SpriteTemplate to the prefab.

v update LevelBuilder.

  v fix level 1 and 2 walls
  v fix zapper hitting non-player stuff

  v fix teleportation acceleration
  v fix random teleport-to-nowhere
  v debug doors

2012.01.20 Vorp Logic
Design:
* Each sprite will have input and output buffers, addressed by
numeric enums.
* During sprite clocking, each sprite will be able to read from input buffers
and write to output buffers.
* In the main loop, a new link-clocking phase will
  * clear all sprite input buffers
  * for each link, add the input value to the output.
For now, expect output buffers to all be 0 or 1, and interpret input as true or
false (non-zero or zero). But I can go all Braitenberg-Vehicles later.
Tasks:
- sprites
  - addressable sprite input and output buffers
  - add addresses to all sprites that have them
  - modified sprite clocking to read and/or write buffers
- links
  - vorp has links between input and output buffers
  - addLink() method
  - link clocking in main loop
- prefabs --> transformers
  v Assign sprite ID at construction.
  - Change hacky prefab orientation code to use vector math like rotation,
    starting with a north-facing sprite model composed of a center vec
    and a radius vec. Wall-hugger placement is informed by a hugPoint and a
    facingVec.
    Double wallhuggers (beam sensor, door, zapper) place each sprite separately.
    Doors are crazy. They might have extra vecs, like a center vec.
  - Transformers map jacks to sprite logic buffers, so links can link.

- redo all levels using links and logic
- Maybe add And and Not sprites

Plasma sprites:
- plasma cannon
- plasma itself
- plasma switch
- test level

Zombie sprites:
- zombie
- zombie assembler

teleport sparks
- implode
- explode
- light up the tube?

Design some new levels
- please enjoy hot plasma
