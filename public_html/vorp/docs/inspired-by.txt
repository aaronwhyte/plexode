Portal:
- teleporters, though mine are very different.
- spare settings, no distractions
- puzzles for their own sake
- cubes, and buttons to rest them on (I made grip-switches, since there's no gravity in Vorp)
- doors
- filter fields
- stationary turrets
- buttons and timers
- plasma balls, to introduce timing constraints
- one goal: exit
- GLaDOS.  Not that I can replicate that in any way, but it sets a great tone.

Portal 2 trailers:
- Thermal discouragement beams

Charles Stoss, mainly Glasshouse:
- Portable teleport gates and their many uses.
- Assembly gates

Ian Banks "Culture" books
- Drones as suitcase-sized slabs
- Effectors fields as the only manipulators you need

Sci-fi in general
- animal/cyborg/robot spectrum
- sentient/obsessed/programmed/tool spectrum
- Tractor beams

Wagonchrist's Musipal album artwork.
Cover art for Jasper Fforde's Shades of Grey - colorful pipes

Augmented reality overlays, for robot and device UIs.

The Exploratorium
- Workshops littered with devices
- Combine physics effects to generate an interesting exhibit.
This might be the real guiding light design pattern:
No plotted sci-fi conflict or characters.  Just matter and ideas,
attention focused by the "finish the level" goal, but with plenty
of time to do free-form experimentation.
Each level could have an idea to express or explore, the understanding of which
is necessary to progress.
